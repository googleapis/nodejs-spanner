/**
 * Node information for nodes appearing in a
 * QueryPlan.plan_nodes.
 *
 * @property {number} index
 *   The `PlanNode`'s index in node
 *   list.
 *
 * @property {number} kind
 *   Used to determine the type of node. May be needed for visualizing
 *   different kinds of nodes differently. For example, If the node is a
 *   SCALAR node, it will have a
 *   condensed representation which can be used to directly embed a description
 *   of the node in its parent.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [Kind]{@link google.spanner.v1.Kind}
 *
 * @property {string} displayName
 *   The display name for the node.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} childLinks
 *   List of child node `index`es and their relationship to this parent.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ChildLink]{@link google.spanner.v1.ChildLink}
 *
 * @property {Object} shortRepresentation
 *   Condensed representation for
 *   SCALAR nodes.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ShortRepresentation]{@link google.spanner.v1.ShortRepresentation}
 *
 * @property {Object} metadata
 *   Attributes relevant to the node contained in a group of key-value pairs.
 *   For example, a Parameter Reference node could have the following
 *   information in its metadata:
 *
 *       {
 *         "parameter_reference": "param1",
 *         "parameter_type": "array"
 *       }
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Struct]{@link google.protobuf.Struct}
 *
 * @property {Object} executionStats
 *   The execution statistics associated with the node, contained in a group of
 *   key-value pairs. Only present if the plan was returned as a result of a
 *   profile query. For example, number of executions, number of rows/time per
 *   execution etc.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Struct]{@link google.protobuf.Struct}
 *
 * @typedef PlanNode
 * @memberof google.spanner.v1
 * @see [google.spanner.v1.PlanNode definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/spanner/v1/query_plan.proto}

   * @property {number} childIndex
   *   The node to which the link points.
   *
   * @property {string} type
   *   The type of the link. For example, in Hash Joins this could be used to
   *   distinguish between the build child and the probe child, or in the case
   *   of the child being an output variable, to represent the tag associated
   *   with the output variable.

   *   Only present if the child node is

   *   a table will have child links to the `SCALAR` nodes representing the
   *   output variables created for each column that is read by the operator.
