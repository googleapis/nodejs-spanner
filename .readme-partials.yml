        ## Multiplexed Sessions

        Spanner's Multiplexed Sessions can now be used as an efficient alternative to the default session pool. This feature helps reduce
        session management overhead and minimize session-related errors. Multiplexed sessions can be enabled for all transaction types via environment variables.

        ### Configuration

        To enable this feature, set the following environment variables to `true`:

        * **For Read-Only Transactions:**
        - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPANNER_MULTIPLEXED_SESSIONS`
        * **For Partitioned Operations:**
        - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPANNER_MULTIPLEXED_SESSIONS`
        - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPANNER_MULTIPLEXED_SESSIONS_PARTITIONED_OPS`
        * **For Read-Write Transactions:**
        - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPANNER_MULTIPLEXED_SESSIONS`
        - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPANNER_MULTIPLEXED_SESSIONS_FOR_RW`

        For a detailed explanation of this feature, please refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/sessions#multiplexed_sessions).
